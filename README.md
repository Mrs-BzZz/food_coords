Configurations are prepared so you don’t have to look for coordinates and animations. 
However, you still need to adjust the correct values so they fit your server. 
I only include food or drink items. If you want to add statuses for drugs, alcohol, stress, or other values, you need to properly integrate them according to the documentation of the scripts you are using. 
If your scripts show errors, you must contact the creator of your script or a programming forum for help—it is beyond our scope to provide support for your scripts.
Thanks for your understanding
